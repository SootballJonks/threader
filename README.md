# THREADERBOT
---
A Discord-bot built for LHL's CyberSec bootcamp. *Very* basic functionality.

## SETUP:
If you want to just upload this to your dev account and use it, here's what you'll need to do:

1. run npm install
2. create a "config.json" file and put your keys like so:
{
  "token": "[YOUR TOKEN]",
  "guildId": "[GUILD ID]",
  "clientId": "[CLIENT ID]"
}
3. host it somewhere?
4. invite the bot to your server

## COMMANDS:
- "/auto":      Will auto-unarchive the current thread.
- "/auto-off":  Will turn off the auto feature - let those threads rest ;)


## INVITE LINK:
I have 24/7 hosting for now. If the bot is offline, I'm no longer hosting it:
